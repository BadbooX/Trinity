Get client ID and client secret

PayPal integrations use a client ID and client secret to authenticate API calls:

    A client ID identifies an app. You only need a client ID to get a PayPal payment button and standard credit and debit card fields.
    A client secret authenticates a client ID. To call PayPal APIs, you'll exchange your client ID and client secret for an access token. Keep this secret safe.

Here's how to get your client ID and client secret:

    Select Log in to Dashboard and log in or sign up.
    Select Apps & Credentials.
    New accounts come with a Default Application in the REST API apps section. To create a new project, select Create App.
    Copy the client ID and client secret for your app.
