## Description

The pipeline is composed of several stages, each of which is executed sequentially. The stages are as follows:

1. **Version Control**: This stage checks out the code from the repository and sets up the environment for the subsequent stages.
2. **Test**: This stage runs the automated tests to verify the correctness of the application.
3. **Code Quality**: This stage runs static code analysis tools to check the quality of the code.
4. **Build**: This stage builds the application from the source code and generates the artifacts that will be used in the deployment stage.
5. **Deploy**: This stage deploys the application to the target environment, such as a staging or production server.
